        I <i>was</i> using Heroku for free to get started, but once I realized that https isn't supported on the free tier, I decided it was high time to learn some AWS.  I have mixed feelings about relying on Amazon and designing around their proprietary environment, but it's a good skill to learn and I think I can figure out how to use a VPS later if I'm not satisfied wtih AWS.
